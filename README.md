Nowadays, the air transport is predominant in the ways of life. Due to the globalization and the fourth industrial 
revolution, people met the need to travel more and more for working, but also for their well-being. These societiesâ€™ 
changes led to increase interactions. 
The purpose of this project is to lead an air transport network data analysis across different scales for four countries: 
the United States, China, the United Kingdom and Australia. For this, different feature-based graph analysis methods 
have been carefully selected to complete the airline network study in these countries on a macro-scale, a mesoscale, and node-level. To enable effective visualization regarding the computation time, the representation will be 
done in a low data dimension, selecting data for one chosen month of flight data across the countries. 
The data used will be analysed as a whole, before demonstrating multi-scale graph analysis for the four given 
countries. At the end of each method, the selection and the application of the metric used will be analysed with 
performance considerations. Thereafter, the potential impact of results on the design of future aircrafts in the different 
countries will be discussed. Finally, the extra-work of this project will be briefly presented. All the codes will be done 
using MATLAB.
